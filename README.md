# UnrealEngine Escape the backrooms



# TODO
* Invisible mouse : Fix it so that when the dll is unloaded from process it shows my mouse(hides mouse when menu is open)(could somehow change execution flow of unloading process to make this work or call ShowCursor())
* Random error message box after closing game :  When unloading the dll from the game there are no issues however, when exiting the game from the games ui(not just closing the window on the tab) a message box appears. To what I know, the time of the unloading of the dll doesnt matter, but its how it is unloaded and how the game unloads when exiting it.

# IMPLEMENTATIONS
* Debug vs Release preprocessor macros(*optional*)
* Adding *core* functionality to this project
