# UnrealEngine Escape the backrooms


#Features:
1. A nice D3D11 hook


# Make sure Singleton pattern/class is all good, make sure its initialized and that static stuff is correct
# As of now, this structure will be fine, although I should move this D3D11Hook to a hooks file instead
* having a render class or function using it, or some other implimentation.
